README - adeskclock
===================

About:
======

adeskclock, an adesklet (http://adesklets.sourceforge.net), is a simple 
analogue clock for your desktop released under GNU/GPL (See `COPYING' 
file for license). 

Authors:
========

Jon McCormack <jonmack@users.sourceforge.net> - code
Phil <> - skins
Igor <> - skins

Fake Maintainer:
================

Sylvain Fourmanoit <syfou@users.sourceforge.net> 

NOTE: I put this online because the desklet is already working OK,
even if not actively maintained anymore. It is not my code, and I am
not sure if I will bring it up to speed yet. If anyone is interested
doing real work on it, just let me know, and I will be happy to pass
the hand.

The original file did contain a subversion tree: you can get it online
from http://www16.brinkster.com/jonmack/python/ .

Requirements:
=============

Initially developed and tested using 
 - adesklets 0.4.3
 - linux 2.6.9 
 - gcc 3.3.5 
 - python 2.3.4

Running:
========

Simply run the `adeskclock.py' script from within its containing directory.

Further Notes:
==============

At this time no external configuration file is available for this adesklet.
Editing the `defaultConfig' dictionary in the `adeskclock.py' script is still
possible, but just be careful ;) Customisation instructions will be included 
in near future versions.

Version History:
================

v0.1.0
 - major rewrite started to accommodate new things.
 - added custom right-click menu for toggling second hand and editing config.
 - refreshRate variable instead of hard coded.
 - hour hand now points to fifths of an hour, instead of quarters - this is more
   like a real clock, where hour hand clicks to minute markers.
 - hand dimensions (needed for rotating) are calculated automatically now.
 - skins now loaded from separate directory: /path/to/adeskclock/skin/<skin_name>/

v0.0.5
 - Cleaning up this README ready for applying for official adesklet status :)
 - Reduced multiple time.time() calls to single time call. 

v0.0.4
 - Clock face art now has hour dots.
 - Hour hand will now show to nearest quarter of an hour.
 - Split up angle calculation functions back from 0.0.3 for new hour
   hand behaviour. Plan is the new spam! Plan, plan, plan, plan...!
 - Known bug: hands are rotated not round a common point, but by the 
   hand images' top-left corner. So the hands are slightly off-set 
   from the centre of the clock. Annoying, but not so bad looking if
   clockface art has a big blob to cover that region :)

v0.0.3
 - Cleaned up angle calculations to one function.

v0.0.2
 - Fixed: clock face graphic not scaling to window size (Thanks to ZeroDivide
   on adesklets forums)
 - Added: New art for clock face and all hands. Vector debugging stuff still in
   there, but there's something wrong with Bresenham algorithm? (Thanks to syfou
   on adesklets forums for checking this)
 - It's at the stage where it at least tells the right time ;)

v0.0.1
 - First released version. Done after a only a few hours of learning python!
 - Still a bit buggy, but hopefully help will be found :)
