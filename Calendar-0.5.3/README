Description:
An basic Calendar desklet

Requirements:
adesklets, python with calendar module, Tkinter module for alarm features

How to run:
The running of the file is simple, just do: ./Calendar.py (the file shoud be executable, if not run chmod u+x ./Calendar.py) at the console.

Features:
Now, new and improved, this desklet includes the following features
* Customisable header cell (font, font colour, border colour, background colour)
* Customisable day cells (font, font colour, border colour, background colour)
* Customisable date cells (font, font colour, border colour, background colour)
* Customisable today cell (font, font colour, border colour, background colour)
* Customisable past days cells (font, font colour, border colour, background colour)
* Customisable cell padding between cells
* Calendar automatically scales to accomodate the largest font
* You can now set which day is the first say of the week (0 = Monday, 6 = Sunday)
* You can set an month offset so you can display a calendar x amount of months and y amount of years in the past or future, ie: month_offset: 6, year_offset: 1 would show a calendar 1 year 6 months in the future. To set dates in the past, use an offset as normal and then set the month_offset_negative or year_offset_negative values to True
* You can now set alarms/reminders/todos/etc using the context menu. At the moment you can not have multiple ones per day. Alarms trigger as soon as a day occurs.
* You can browse months and years on the calendar by using the Next and Prev buttons on the context menu

Themeing:
For the moment, themeing can be done through the config.txt file that will be generated when first running the desklet.
When setting colours, use HTML style colour codes. If you want to set alpha transparency, you can do so like this:
'FFFFFF' = fully white, 'FFFFFF80' = white at 50% transparency. Note the extra hex byte value for transparency.
To remove border/backgrounds/etc just set the colour to 100% transparency

Planned:
* Adding a simple way to include theme classes that override the standard theme (hardish)
* Adding a way to set reminders that are triggered time-specifically (easyish)
* Other stuff I have yet to think of (?)
