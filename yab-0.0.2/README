README
===================

This is yet another [launch] bar (hence the name - yab), because 
adesklets was needing at least one. Nothing new under the sun - 
a very classic bar, yet reasonably polished, highly configurable and
resources limit aware (In fact, it can be made really frugal by turning
off the right options - see the `config.txt.minimal' example).

This desklet does not have any requirements other than adesklets >=
0.4.0 with python support enabled (default), but it will absolutely
refuse to work on anything older. It was tested on python 2.4.0 final, 
on a linux 2.6.10 glibc 2.3.4 x86 machine.

Just run the `yab.py' script from its final location on you disk
to start the desklet: of course, you need to have adesklets installed.
With your favorite editor, you may edit config.txt for settings
specific to this desklet.

Have a look at http://adesklets.sf.net/ for more details on this program.

What's new in version 0.0.2
---------------------------

Nothing, really. It's only a maintenance release to switch to the 
ConfigFile class now included in adesklets.utils since 
adesklets 0.4.0.
