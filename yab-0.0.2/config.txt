#================================================================================
#    This is the configuration file for the adesklets' desklet
#    `Yet Another Bar' (yab).
#
#    You may specify here, for each yab instance you use,
#    what icons should be loaded (stored under `icons/' by default,
#    but absolute path names are also valid), what commands they should trigger,
#    what the captions should be, what font to use, how generating effects,
#    etc.
#
#    See `config.txt.minimal' in this directory for the configuration
#    of the completely static (all effects turned off) version of the
#    default bar with some explanations.
#
#    There is no real need for a long explanation here, since
#    a lot of yab configuration parameters are self explanatory.
#    Let us just mention here some specific, less obvious elements:
#
#    - colors are expressed as packed RGB hexadecimal on 24 bits
#    (1 unsigned byte per channel), as you can use within HTML documents
#    for instance: '000000' is pure black, while 'FFFFFF' is pure white.
#
#    - similarily, opacities are given as unsigned one byte decimal
#    integer value (hence in [0, 255])
#
#    - gradient_angle is given in degree, not radians, with 0 degrees being
#    vertical from top to bottom and going clockwise from there.
#    
#    - all parameters expressing times are in seconds. On most systems,
#    resulting timing of less than 10 milliseconds are not reliable and
#    should be avoided.
#    
#    - many parameters can be set to None, zero or similar values, resulting
#    in a more frugal, less dynamic desklet - see `config.txt.minimal' for
#    a more complete exemplification of this.
#
#    - the 'click_effect' parameter, if not set to None, is an imlib2
#    dynamic filter expression that will get applied to the icon you just
#    clicked on for 'click_effect_duration' seconds before being discarded.
#    See your imlib2 documentation for details.
#
#    - the 'icon_maximize_threshold' specifies at what fraction of maximal
#    size the icon under the pointer should be displayed as completly
#    maximized (set to 90% by default). It gives a way to define a 'hot zone'
#    around the icon center's x coordinate in which the pointer can move
#    and the icon stay stuck on its maximum size anyway. Setting this
#    to 0 would make an icon being maximized as soon as the pointer
#    get over it, and setting it to 1 to never get 'pinned' on maximum
#    size as long as the pointer does not reach its very center
#    (thus being smoothly resized from the minimal to the maximal size).
#
#    - all configuration parameters are handled the 'pythonic way', meaning
#    that as few checkups as possible are performed, invalid entries leading
#    to runtime exceptions being raised. For instance, building a bar
#    longer than its screen width will raise a 'did not resize window' error.
#
#    So, whenever you run into trouble configuring a yab instance, you should:
#
#    	* Kill all adesklets instances running:
#
#    		killall -9 adesklets
#
#    	* Restart the troublemaker from the console using
#        (XXX being its ID number):
#    
#    		ADESKLETS_ID=XXX python yab.py	
#
#        * Look at the error output to figure things out.
#
#    Finally, please note that destroying this config file while no yab instances
#    are running will force its repopulation with valid default
#    entries on yap's desklets restart.
#    
#    === Special note on icons ===
#    
#    Only a few icons are shipped with yab (five, actually).
#    In case you are wondering, they all come from the Lila theme
#    resources (http://lila-theme.uni.cc/). If you go hunting
#    for more iconographic artwork, http://www.kde-look.org/
#    is also a good start point.
